SO, I might be slightly coffee-addicted. But! I actually don't really drink it to wake up. Sure, I drink it every morning as a part of waking up, but whenever I drink it later in the day, I don't feel like it affects me that much. So maybe I'm coffee-addicted but not only for the taste?

Okay, it might just be because my body is so used to drinking (a lot of) coffee almost every single day, and has gotten used to the caffeine. But I still remember when I first started drinking coffee years ago, that I never felt like it affected me that much, save for a few occations when I may have started vibrating slightly. My point is, that I mostly drink it because I love it, mostly with some milk in. Sometimes I do worry that it might be bad for me, but if I worry a lot then I ususally take a small break for a few days, or try to not drink more than 1-2 cups a day. 

This post is mostly just a ramble I thought of, because I found it a lot of fun to learn about how to make a blog and post my own little texts. And I thought "why not write about coffee, since I love it so much?"I would really like to learn more about this, and how to make my posts both look more cool and fancy, and how to maintain a habit of writing more regularly. I also want to not be too strict with myself, and don't stress too much if I don't understand something or don't feel like writing for a while. 

This is only supposed to be a fun little experiment for me, both to strengthen my writing and coding experience :) With that, I'll round up (is that a saying in english as well as norwegian?) and finish my second post! 

To future me: I hope you're having fun with this, and that you've learned something new. I know I have :D
