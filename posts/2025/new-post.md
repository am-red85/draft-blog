In March 2024 I volunteered at the Booster Conference. I enjoyred this a lot, and when the opportunity to apply for this year came, I immediately took it. 

Similar to last year, my shifts have consisted of sitting in the reception (answering questions and scanning tickets), being room host at lightning talks and experience reports (making sure mics are working, keeping time and giving gifts to the speakers), and generally being available to help with different tasks. This year, however, I have one shift as room host for a workshop (guess which one). I was actually a little nervous, because I felt slightly uncertain about what my duties would be. But thanks to the comittee and my friend, who's already been in a workshop and told me what it was like, my worries were lessened. 

So far, I've found this workshop very interesting! And the Conference as a whole has been a really fun experience <3
